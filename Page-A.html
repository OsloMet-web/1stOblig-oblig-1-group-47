<h1>Assignment from DATA1100</h1>
<p>Imagine that three years from now, you have finished your degree at OsloMet
    and have just been recruited to one of the largest consultancy firms in Norway.
    In the first week in your new position, you are told by your supervisor that, 
    in addition to your individual tasks, you will be working with a small team 
    of 5-6 people, who regularly meet to discuss and find good balanced solutions
    to complex situations and problems within the company or society in general. </p>
<h2>Case</h2>
<p2>Your first assignment as a group is to investigate the pros/cons of working in a group. 
    In what areas can you contribute. What sort of situations, problems or cases are best 
    solved in groups? What does this way of working say about what your company focuses on?
    Use the form below to discuss such issues. Attempt to stay within the set timeframe. 
    Submit the completed form in Canvas. At the end of the form is a suggestion for a group
    contract. It is recommended that you fill in this contract and hand it in together with
    the form.

 You may collaborate through "mob programming" instead, where one person ("driver") writes
  while the rest ("mob") view the code on a shared screen and assists. -->
