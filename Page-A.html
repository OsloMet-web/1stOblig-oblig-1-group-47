<h1>Assignment from DATA1100</h1>
<p>Imagine that three years from now, you have finished your degree at OsloMet<br> 
    and have just been recruited to one of the largest consultancy firms in Norway.<br> 
    In the first week in your new position, you are told by your supervisor that, <br> 
    in addition to your individual tasks, you will be working with a small team <br> 
    of 5-6 people, who regularly meet to discuss and find good balanced solutions<br> 
    to complex situations and problems within the company or society in general. </p>
  
<h2>Case</h2>
  
<p2>Your first assignment as a group is to investigate the pros/cons of working in a group. <br> 
    In what areas can you contribute. What sort of situations, problems or cases are best <br> 
    solved in groups? What does this way of working say about what your company focuses on?<br> 
    Use the form below to discuss such issues. Attempt to stay within the set timeframe. <br> 
    Submit the completed form in Canvas. At the end of the form is a suggestion for a group<br> 
    contract. It is recommended that you fill in this contract and hand it in together with
    the form.

<!-- Step 4: Create a simple HTML webpage (A)
Paste in at least part of the text from an "Innovation camp" assignment
 or an DATA1100 hand-in. Ensure that there are at least two headings.
 You should — but do not have to — collaborate on this page through Pull-request and Push-requests. 
 You may collaborate through "mob programming" instead, where one person ("driver") writes
  while the rest ("mob") view the code on a shared screen and assists. -->
