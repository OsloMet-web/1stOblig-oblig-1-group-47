<!-- Step 5: Create a second page (B)
In this page, every student in the group enters their own student number as a heading, 
and a few lines about their old school in a paragraph. ("My VGS had the best canteen lay-out in the region. 
A space over two floors where people could 'see and be seen', or hide in a nook.")
You must do this through Pull-request and Push-requests!
    OR
through updates (commits) directly in GitHub online

In the log ("Commits") on GitHub, we expect to see every student in the group as a collaborator.

In each page, include a link from Page A to Page B, and vice versa. -->
